    super.viewDidLoad() // always let super call the lifecycle methods
    // When the view controller loads the `view` into memory.
    // do primary setup of your viewcontroller here.
    // good time to update my view using my model, because my outlets are set
    
    // * Do not do geometry-related setup here!  Your bounds are not yet set!
    
    // This method gets called once when the views are loaded to the memory
    // 1. Initialization of views
    // 2. Network requests
    // 3. Database access

  }
  
  // For work that will be performed multiple times, your app can rely on these
  // view event notifications (life cycle methods)
  
  
  /// This method will be sent just before your ViewController appears (or re-apprears) on screen.
  override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {

    // Note: this method can be called repeatedly (vs. viewDidLoad is only called once)
    // 1. Updating user location.
    // 2. Updating or refreshing some views.
    // 3. Starting a network requests
    // 4. adjust screen orientations. (portrait, landscape)

  // This method will be called just after your ViewController has finished appearing on screen.
  override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    // start a timer or an animation or start observing something.
    
    // This is also a good place to start something expensive.
    // why kick off expensive things here instead of in viewDidLoad?
    // Because we know we're on screen so it won't be a waste.
    // By "expensive" we usually mean "time consuming" but could also mean battery or storage.
    
    // We must never block our UI from user interaction (thus background fetching, etc.)
    // Our UI might need to come up incomplete and later fill in when expensive operation is done.
    // We use "spinning wheels" and such to let the user know we're fetching something expensive.
    // 1. start an animation
    // 2. long running code (expensive)

  }
  
  // Gets called right before the view disappears from the screen.
  // Your viewcontroller is still on screen, but it's about to go off screen.
  // ex. when the user hit "back" in a UINavigationController
  //     the user switched to another tab in UITabBarController
  override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
    // often you just undo what you did in viewDidAppear
    // for example, stop a timer or animation you started in viewDidAppear or stop observing
    // 1. saving edits.
    // 2. hiding keyboards.
    // 3. canceling network requests or stopping an animation
  
  }
  
  // Gets called right after the view disappears from the screen.
  // (usually after the user navigated to a new view)
  // Somewhat rare to do something here, but occasionally you might want to "clean up" your viewcontroller
  // ex. you could save some state or release some large, recreatable resource/
  override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
    // clean up this viewcontroller
    // 1. stop services related to the view. (playing audio, removing notification observers)
